    Air Signs
  </h2>
</body>
<p class="signinformation"> Air signs are known to be afraid of commitment, quite detached and they change their mind often. However, air signs tend to be able to make decisions without letting their emotions take control. Air signs tend to be deep thinkers and they notice everything. They live in their mind a lot, and tend to keep to themselves to some extent which makes them hard to read. They are easy to make connections with and tend to be easy to talk to. Libras in particular (but all air signs) tend to be social butterflies and pull friend groups together. Air signs love adventure and new experiences, and tend to be spontaneous.
Air signs tend to best get along with other air signs, as well as fire signs- so Leo’s, Aries’ & Sagittarius.
 </p>
 <h2 id="earth signs"> Earth Signs </h2>
 <p class="signinformation"> Earth signs are known to be stubborn, determined and reliable. Earth signs take their commitments very seriously, and are very dedicated in whatever they do. Whether it's their schooling, work, or family commitments- earth signs have a strong sense of duty and responsibility. Earth signs, while responsible, tend to enjoy the finer things in life. They will make sure they’re able to indulge in the things they enjoy- as all of their hard work has to be for something. Earth signs are very stubborn, especially taurus’s. They tend to have very strong ideas or principles, and find it hard to compromise. Earth signs tend to be resistant to change, but it isn't impossible for them. They are goal setters and will work to get what they want. They are very determined and won’t let anything set them back from achieving their goals.
Earth signs tend to get along best with other earth signs, as well as water signs. So Cancer’s, Pisces, & Scorpio’s.
</p>
<h2 id="water signs"> Water Signs </h2>
<p class="signinformation">Water signs are known to be the cry babies of the zodiac, sensitive and emotional. However, water signs are actually empathetic and intuitive. Water signs are highly observant and notice everything. They find it easy to read people and tend to have a few close friends rather than a lot of not so close friends. Water signs are highly emotional, they feel deeply and are very empathetic, which helps them to form deep relationships with their pairs. Their emotions are very intense so they often feel very overwhelmed. Their minds race and they tend to get lost in thought often. Water signs crave validation and inclusion, they’re very creative and sometimes indecisive.
Water signs tend to get along best with other water signs, as well as earth signs. So Taurus, Virgo’s & Capricorn’s.
</p>
<h2 id="fire signs"> Fire Signs </h2>
<p class="signinformation"> Fire signs tend to be passionate and temperamental. Like fire, they can be quite destructive. Fire signs tend to be the life of the party, and always know how to have a good time. They butt-heads with others often, and tend to hold grudges if something or someone gets in their way. Fire signs are very competitive and creative, and have a huge passion for life and everything it entails. Fire signs hate to be vulnerable, and tend to try to cover up their emotions. This makes it hard to get close to a fire sign, as they don't like letting people in. However on the other side, once a fire sign does open up to you they will be very caring and loving towards you. Bare-in mind that fire signs are still very independent people, and tend to stay away from overly clingy people.
Fire signs tend to get along best with other fire signs, as well as air signs. So Gemini’s, Libra’s & Aquarius.
